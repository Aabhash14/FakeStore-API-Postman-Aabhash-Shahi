Domain : https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#tag/Products
API Testing Tool: Postman

Testing Description:
I performed API testing on the FakeStore API using Postman to validate CRUD operations for products and carts using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT). The testing verified correct response codes, data retrieval, resource creation and updates, and proper error handling for invalid request payloads, ensuring API functionality and data integrity.
